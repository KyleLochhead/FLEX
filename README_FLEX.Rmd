### Introduction
The *FLEX* module was developed to estimate the effects of forest change on fisher populations. It is an agent-based model, which are models that simulate the actions of agents (in this case, individual fisher) in response to their environment (i.e., habitat) based on their ecology and behaviour. Therefore, it is a 'bottom-up' approach, where the behaviours of individuals are simulated to understand the collective impacts to a population.

Here we describe the logic of how *FLEX* simulates the ecology and behaviour of individual fisher. *FLEX* works with within the Castor set of models through the *fisherHabitatCastor* module, where *fisherHabitatCastor* estimates fisher habitat attributes from forest stand attributes that are estimated from *forestryCastor* (a forest simulator). Therefore, the fisher agents simulated in *FLEX* interact with landscapes simulated from *forestryCastor*. This version of the model only simulates female fisher, and therefore assumes the landscape does not affect interactions, and thus mating rates, between males and females.  

The *FLEX* module consists of an initiation (init) phase that establishes fisher on the landscape, and an annual simulation phase, that iteratively simulates individual fisher life-history events and behaviours over the coruse of a year, including survival, dispersal and territory formation, reproduction and aging. Below we describe these phases and events in more detail.

### Habitat Input to FLEX
The *FLEX* module interacts with the landscape and fisher habitat though the habitat data parameter (rasterHabitat), which is specified as a multi-band raster in Tag Image File Format (TIFF). This includes data on the location of fisher habitat sub-populations, and the location (presence or absence) of each fisher habitat type (denning, rust, movement, coarse-woody debris, cavity and open) across the simulation area of interest for each simulation interval, as specified in the forest simulator (i.e., *forestryCastor*). Therefore, it provides estimates of the location of key fisher habitat types over time as it changes in response to forest dynamics, including potentially disturbances such as forestry or fire. The rasterHabitat parameter is provided as an output from *fisherHabitatCastor* when run concurrently with *forestryCastor*. 

### Initiation of the Fisher Population 
The *FLEX* module starts by establishing a fisher population on the landscape, which consists of placing adult female fisher within denning habitat across the landscape. The general objective of the init phase is to 'saturate' the landscape with fisher, i.e., identify the number of fisher territories that can be supported by the habitat in the landscape. To do that, the init phase identifies the number of fisher that potentially could be supported on the landscape, distributes them across the landscape based on the distribution of fisher denning habitat, and then determines which fisher can form a territory. The result of that process is a landscape at or close to its maximum potential for fisher occupancy. Therefore the assumed starting point of the model is a fisher population at its carrying capacity for the habitat in the landscape. 

#### Identifying the Number of Fisher to Place on the Landscape
The user can either specify the number of fisher to distribute on the landscape using the initialFisherPop, or estimate the number of fisher to distribute on the landscape based on the average fisher home range size and the distribution of denning habitat across the study area. We currently recommend using the latter approach to ensure that a saturated landscape is achieved. 

To estimate the number of fisher on the landscape, first the model aggregates the existing pixels (typically 1 ha) in the area of interest into larger pixels with the size of the average home range for fisher across all fisher habitat types (i.e., 3,750 ha). Then the number of aggregated pixels with greater than 1% denning habitat within them are summed to determine the number of fisher to distribute across the landscape. 

#### Distributing Fisher Across the Landscape
Fisher are randomly distributed across the landscape following a well-balanced sampling design (see: [Brus 2003](https://dickbrus.github.io/SpatialSamplingwithR/BalancedSpreaded.html#LPM)). Specifically, the local pivot method was used, where the first location was selected randomly, and then additional locations are selected where locations in closer proximity are less likely to be selected, until the target number of locations (i.e., the number of fisher) are met. The method also considers inclusion probabilities, which are currently set as equal across all locations.

#### Fisher Agent Creation
Once the starting number of fisher are distributed across the landscape, an "agents" table is created where each starting fisher receives a unique identifier, the location on the landscape (pixelid) of its starting point, a sex (currently all fisher in the model are female) and an age, selected randomly, based on the estimated distribution of fisher ages from populations in British Columbia (see table below).

```{r, age distribution}

data <- data.table (age = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12), 
                    prob = c(0.44, 0.27, 0.08, 0.08, 0.06, 0.03, 0.02, 
                             0.01,0.0025,0.0025,0.0025,0.0025))

ggplot (data,
        aes (x = age, y = prob)) + 
  geom_bar (stat ="identity")



```

Each fisher in the agents table then gets assigned a target amount of habitat it needs to from a territory. In this model, the quality of habitat is not quantified. Therefore rather than have the fisher form a territory by aggregating habitat until it achieves a specified, minimum amount of quality habitat, the amount of habitat each fisher needs is assigned randomly. *TBD: The amount of habitat each fisher is assigned is drawn from a normal distribution of the amount and variability in habitat from known fisher home ranges (see table below).* Note that in this case, the amount of habitat in a territory may be less than estimated home range sizes for fisher, depending on the method used (e.g., kernel density estimator or minimum convex polygon), and specifically if the home range estimate included areas that are not necessarily fisher habitat.

```{r, habitat for territory}
data.table (fisher_pop = c (1:4), 
            hr_mean = c (3000, 4500, 4500, 3000),
            hr_sd = c (500, 500, 500, 500))

```

#### Fisher Territory Formation
Each fisher in the agents table then forms a territory by 'spreading' from it's starting den site location to adjacent habitat, until it achieves it's habitat target, or it is no longer able to spread to adjacent areas because it is poor habitat or is occupied by another fisher (i.e., overlap of potential territories is not allowed). The model uses the [spread2 function](https://rdrr.io/cran/SpaDES.tools/man/spread2.html) in the [SpaDES R package](https://spades.predictiveecology.org/) to form territories. In this function, a raster of spread probabilities is used to define where the fisher can 'spread'. In the FLEX model, locations (i.e., 1 ha pixels in the raster) with denning, rust, cavity, coarse-woody debris (cwd), or movement habitats have a 100% spread probability, locations with open habitat have a 9% spread probability and all other locations have an 18% spread probability. The function then 'spreads' across the raster from the starting den site into adjacent areas, preferentially but not exclusively into fisher habitat types, until it either reaches its target amount of habitat, or is unable to spread further. Each unique spread area is then identified as the potential territory area for each fisher. 

Once the potential territory is identified, it is checked to make sure it meets several habitat criteria. If it meets the criteria then it is considered an active territory for the individual fisher occupying it. Otherwise, the potential territory gets removed from the landscape (i.e., is not considered occupied) and the fisher gets re-assigned as a 'disperser' without an active territory. To be considered an active territory, the territory must achieve the target habitat size, consist of a minimum of 85% of its area as denning, rust, cavity, cwd, or movement habitat and consist of a minimum amount of denning, resting (i.e., rust, cavity, and cwd added togethe) and movement habitat types. The minimum amount criteria can be set as parameters by the user, i.e., *den_target*, *rest_target* and *move_target*, respectively. 

#### Fisher Survival 
Once territories are formed, the surivial of individual fisher is 







#### Fisher Dispersal 
Fishers that don't form an active territory in the previous step are provided an opportunity to disperse and attempt to form a territory elsewhere. This helps to 'saturate' the landscape with fisher as part of the initiation phase of the model (i.e., maximize the amount of fisher territories that are occupied in the landscape). 

In this dispersal step, the locations of all denning habitat pixels that are unoccupied in the area of interest are identified. The landscape is then aggregated (i.e., the resolution of the pixels on the landscape) from 1 ha pixels to the average size of a female fisher home range (i.e., 3,375 ha), and aggregated pixels that contain greater than 1% of denning habitat are considered as candidate areas for dispersal. A sub-set of these areas is sampled based on the number of dispersing fisher (i.e., fishers that were unable to form a territory in the initial territory formation step), using the well-balanced sampling design local pivot method, to ensure they are adequately spaced. The distance from each dispersing fisher location to each den site location in the sample of candidate areas is then calculated, and each fisher is assigned to the nearest potential den site location within the well-balanced sample of potential candidate den site areas. The location of each dispersing fisher is updated to the new den site location.

Once each dispersing fisher is assigned to a new den site location, each fisher again forms a territory by 'spreading' from it's den site location to adjacent habitat, until it achieves it's habitat target. Similar to the initial territory formation step, the potential territories are checked to ensure they meet minimum size and habitat configuration requirements. If the criteria are not met, then the fisher remains as a disperser.  

This disperseal step is completed in two phases, where first adults disperse and then juveniles. This ensures that more mature animals are given priority in forming territories.  






Then dispersers attempt to find a new territory 
-	Finds dennign pixels not in a territory
-	Identifies potential # terriotires using eth ggregation function
o	If more dispersers than potential, then some fisher sdont; get a locations
-	Then use well spread sampling to disperse fisher
-	 Finds the closest denning site for a fisher; the closest fisher gets the dennign site
-	Adults get priority over juveniles in the denning too 
-	Successful dispersers then attempt to spread a territory and check that needs are met







                                       
                                       
                                       









### Input Parameters
The *FLEX* module requires that the user specify the fisher habitat data and several ecological parameters for fisher.



Survival parameters consist of a table (survival_rate_table) that is 'hard-coded' in the model (i.e., it currently cannot be directly input by the user). Survival rates are defined by age class, for each population (boreal, sub-boreal moist, sub-boreal dry, and dry forest) and for dispersers and non-dispersers (i.e., animals with a territory). The age classes are 1 to 2 years old, 3 to 5 years old, 5 to 8 years old and greater than 8 years old (all classes are inclusive). Therefore, there are thirty-two survival rates in the table for each population, age class and disperser class. Note that animals less than 1 year old do not have a survival rate, as survival is a component of the recruitment rate (see below).

Similar to the survival parameters, the reproductive parameters consist of table of recruitment rates (repro_rate_table) that is 'hard-coded' in the model. A rate is specified for each population and thus there four recruitment rates in the table. These recruitment rates represent the probability that kit survives to a juvenile (age 1). For reproduction, the user can also specify a sex ratio (sex_ratio) for assigning the proportion of kits that are female (the default value is 0.5), and the minimum age a aisher has to be to reproduce (reproductive_age; the default value is 2 years old).
