# The FLEX

The FLEX tool (Fisher Landscape Explorer) will use BC government warehouse publicly available layers to build the landbase and empirical and expert data to specify “suitable” fisher habitat (i.e., the relative probability of occupancy) as per the BC Fisher Habitat Working Group habitat retention tools guidance (https://www.bcfisherhabitat.ca/habitat-tools/) and the Weir and Corbould (2010) predictive variable for “openness”.

The current repository is a SpaDES compatible IBM model that simulates Fisher life cycle through time and generates a heatmap of fisher habitat area.
